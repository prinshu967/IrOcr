# 🔍 **Infrared OCR for Packed Food Detection**

## 📜 **Overview**

This project combines **YOLO-based object detection** and **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** to analyze packed food items. The system is designed to detect and count food packages using real-world images and accurately extract crucial details like **expiry dates, brand names**, and **manufacturing information**. The integration of infrared cameras enhances detection precision, making it ideal for food freshness detection and inventory management.
